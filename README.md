This is an extension of the respiratoryCare.csv and patient.csv and hospital.csv

Hospital and patient csv were merged by the hospital id. all hospital.csv columns were brought over to patient.csv

Patient_Hospital.csv is the new file and makes hospital based analysis more accessible.

respiratoryCare.csv went through extensive transformation in order to create three new csvs

Please review the ipynb for further details on how the csvs were created.
