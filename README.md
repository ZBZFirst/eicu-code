Fixing the Data Dump from respiratoryCare.csv

This is an extension of the respiratoryCare.csv and patient.csv and hospital.csv

Hospital and patient csv were merged by the hospital id. all hospital.csv columns were brought over to patient.csv

Patient_Hospital.csv is the new file and makes hospital based analysis more accessible.

respiratoryCare.csv went through extensive transformation in order to create three new csvs

Please review the ipynb for further details on how the csvs were created. Please be aware, some of the input cells are just part of validation techniques in order to ensure no data was dropped or left behind. Goodluck with your endeavors.
